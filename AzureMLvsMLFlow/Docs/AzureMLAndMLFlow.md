# Azure Machine Learning vs MLFlow

Azure Databricks is one of the premier big data and analytics resources in Microsoft Azure. As Databricks has grown in popularity, especially with Data Scientists, the importance of a machine learning management platform grows ever more important. As [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/) is integrated into Azure Databricks it becomes the default platform to manage data science experiments from development to production, however, I believe that [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/overview-what-is-azure-ml) is a viable, and often better, tool choice for data scientists. In the demonstration available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ryanchynoweth44/AzureMachineLearningWithDatabricks) I show users how to train and track machine learning models using MLFlow, Azure Machine Learning, and MLFlow's integration with Azure Machine Learning.  

MLFlow is centered around enhancing the engineer's ability to **track experiments** to give visibility of performance during development and in production, manage models by tracing them to specific experiments, and package machine learning code so that it is reusable, reproduceable, and sharable.
